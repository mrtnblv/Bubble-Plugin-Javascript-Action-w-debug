    "description": "This plugin lets you execute custom JavaScript code directly from a workflow.\n\nIt supports both synchronous and asynchronous scripts (await, fetch, etc.).\n\nðŸ’¡ Debug Mode: When enabled, the plugin logs your script, result, and any errors to the browser console. This makes it easy to test, troubleshoot, and understand whatâ€™s going on in your code â€” especially when working with complex or async logic.\n\nðŸ’¡ Helpers:\n\n- helpers.log(...args)\nLogs one or more values to the browser console, prefixed with [JSAction].\n\n- helpers.delay(ms)\nReturns a Promise that resolves after a given delay (can be used with await).\n\n- helpers.now()\nReturns the current date and time as an ISO string.\n\n",
